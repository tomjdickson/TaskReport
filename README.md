# TaskReport

## Introduction
The purpose of this script is to capture a daily / weekly / monthly status of my Trello organisation board. 

## Motivation
At the start of each week I provide my boss with a status of what I am currently working on. This is a time consuming task for me. Recently I have moved to managing all my work inside Trello a "{Company} To-Do " Board, doing this will allow me for example to report on how long a task has been open or in my backlog.

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repo.
2. Open the console and navigate to the scripts root directory.
3. Install the script `npm install`.
NOTE: After installing please follow the configuration steps.
